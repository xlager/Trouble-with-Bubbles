# Trouble with Bubbles

A unity project based on a flash game called Bubble Trouble. 
My reason to work on this game is beacause me and my brothers enjoyed playing it a long time ago and I rarely see any of this on games today.

# Gameplay

The gameplay consists on the player walking under bouncing balls and shoot them without getting hit.
